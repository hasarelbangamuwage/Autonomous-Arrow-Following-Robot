# 🤖 Autonomous Arrow Following Robot

## 📌 Overview

The Autonomous Arrow Following Robot is a hardware-software integrated robotic system designed to detect and follow directional arrows using color detection and sensor input.

The robot uses image processing concepts and IR sensors to navigate autonomously based on arrow direction.

This project was developed as an academic group project in 2024.
